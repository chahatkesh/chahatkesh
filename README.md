I build production-ready web applications as a full-stack developer with frontend expertise. My focus is on creating scalable, performant user interfaces backed by solid engineering principles — clean code, maintainable architecture, and industry-standard practices. My approach balances beautiful, intuitive user experiences with solid technical foundations.

Currently building **Ninja at Zenbase Technologies (Singapore)** as a Founding Engineer, where I'm architecting a production-ready AI-powered sales automation and CRM platform for real-estate agents. I'm also an **Entrepreneur in Residence at iHub AwaDH (IIT Ropar)**, developing AI-powered solutions for real-world problems under IIT Ropar's incubation ecosystem.

Previously, I worked on optimizing ML pipelines and building modular AI systems at **Annam.ai (IIT Ropar)** as a Research Intern, where I improved inference accuracy through data modeling. I've also built 15+ reusable UI components at **Level SuperMind**, achieving 30% faster load times, and developed a certificate generation module at **Xceed, NIT Jalandhar** that's now used by 20+ college clubs.
