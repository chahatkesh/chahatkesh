I design and develop scalable, production-ready systems that solve real problems. My work focuses on building AI-driven platforms, architecting full-stack applications, and creating user-centric interfaces that balance performance with functionality. I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions through clean code, thoughtful design, and modern engineering practices.

Currently building **Ninja at Zenbase Technologies (Singapore)** as a Founding Engineer, where I'm architecting a production-ready AI-powered sales automation and CRM platform for real-estate agents.
